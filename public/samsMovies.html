<h1>3 Fucking Greatest Movies of All Time</h1>
<h2>According to Sam mf Quiggins</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Into the Spiderverse/Across the Spiderverse</h3>
<p>This animation is ground breaking and changing the landscape of animated films. It was a tie between the original and the sequel
</p>
<h3>Green Street Hooligans</h3>
<p>Used to be my fav but havent seen it in a long time. Must revisit to confirm. Elijah Wood is weird</p>
<h3>LOTR Two Towers</h3>
<p>Could honestly list more LOTR but this was my favorite of the triology</p>
